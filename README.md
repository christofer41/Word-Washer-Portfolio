Word Washer (Portfolio)

This program will take in a .tsv file and replace specific words with whatever the user wants.

The user can write in a specific word that they want to replace and then what they want it to be replaced with. Those words will be saved in an array that for this program stored locally.
Then when the user loads up a .tsv file, the program will go through every single word and check if there is any word that needs to be replaced and replace it with the new word.
The user can also just add a space and the word will be replaced instead.
After it has gone through all the words, the program will display the modified .tsv file as an HTML Table, and a download button will appear for the user to download the new file.

The words are saved locally in this specific version, however, on the version that was made for the company, everything is saved on a Node.js server.
